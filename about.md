We provide highly personalized and optimized wealth management solution
powered by our AI investment platform "Sweet-Cinnamon"

## Our Approach

### Market Neutral Strategies
Cinnamon-labs started as an algorithmic trading team. We have developed a bunch of different market-neutral strategies based on our expertise in both investment and data analysis. We offer our clients a chance to invest with our outstanding trading strategies.

### Machine Learning
We don't believe that AI can prove everything in investment. However, if we can properly use the power of machine learning and state-of-the-art AI techniques they could be surprisingly helpful. We carefully define problems we have and collect data to solve the problem. With this problem-solving process, our system is still getting better.

### Human-Like But Optimized
We believe understanding human behavior is the key element in generating profitable algorithms. Making an investment decision is one of the most logical but also an emotional process. That is why we are trying to combine a human edge with a quant edge. Based on the experienced traders' insight we follow traces of market participants' behaviors. Trace here is data they made from their transactions or orders.
